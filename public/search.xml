        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Artificial General Intelligence represented by large models is sweeping in, gradually affecting all aspects of work and life. However, the three major challenges of high cost, long cycle, and low success rate in the field of drug research and development still weigh on us. In order to better cope with these challenges, we are excited to introduce to you an exciting technical innovation - a brand new partner for drug research and development, AI Assistant SciMind, a large-scale multi-modal hybrid expert system model born for the biomedical field.</p><p>🌐 The Perfect Convergence of Large Models and Drug Research and Development: ChatGPT has sparked public expectations for large models, but large models consume big data, and data in the biomedical field is scarce, with low utilization rates. The data and models are stuck in a vicious cycle, resulting in even the most advanced existing large models, such as GPT4, being unable to effectively handle tables, chemical molecules, and biological sequences and other information in biomedical documents. Based on the world’s leading chemical information extraction tool αExtractor, we automatically structure the information, including molecular images, in documents and patents with the highest current accuracy. Based on pharmaceutical big data, we build a multi-modal large model for pharmaceutical documents.</p><p>🔬 Freer Retrieval and Q&amp;A: The speed at which literature and patents are produced has now exceeded the limits of what the human brain can handle. Simple filtering through search engines and presentation through knowledge graphs can no longer meet the requirements. Moreover, the massive internal documents produced by pharmaceutical companies and research institutions also urgently need to be better archived and utilized. We need a more flexible document summarization and knowledge Q&amp;A system to quickly understand the current state of research and not miss the latest research results.</p><p>🚀 More Powerful Molecular Design Toolchain: Too many parameters in drug design tools to use? SciMind integrates the most advanced molecular property prediction, molecular generation, and structure optimization tools. Just state your needs, and you, who are most familiar with the project and have the most chemical intuition, can use them with zero threshold and controllably, without “middlemen” in CADD making a profit.<br>Now, let’s delve into the principles of SciMind’s model, its widely applicable usage scenarios, multi-dimensional capability evaluations, and how to apply for a trial, and jointly reveal this technological miracle that leads drug research and development!</p>]]></content>
